# Python pseudocode

1. Reads in a FASTA file of nucleotide (DNA) sequences

sequence <- read in FASATA file
take out first like that starts with ^ in "file"

2. Carry out the translation to a protein sequence in all possible frames
amino <- dictionary translating codons to corresponding proteins

# Function that converts codon to protein
def translate(base, orf):
  for base in range(0, len(sequence), 3):
      codon = sequence[base:base+3]
      orf.append(amino[codon])
  return orf

# Create lists for each open reading frame

ofr1 <- list []
orf2 <- list []
orf3 <- list []

def dna_to_protein(file):
    # First ORF
    for base in 0:len(file):
        translate(base, orf1)

    # Second ORF
    for base in 1:-2:
        translate(base, orf2)

    # Third ORF
    for base in 2:-1:
        translate(base, orf3)


# Finding double basic putative sites


3. Finds  putative cleavage sites which are â€œdouble basic" (e.g., KK, KR, RK, RR) in the protein sequence

def double_basic(location):
    site <- 0
    for protein in location:
      site += 1
      if (protein:protein+1) == KK or KR or RK or RR:
          print("Putative cleavage site at site number {}".format(str(site))


4. Outputs the resulting protein sequences and the possible locations in a FASTA file that carries the description field from the nucleotide entry.
The locations of the cleavage sites should be described in the description field
